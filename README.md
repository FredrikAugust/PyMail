# PyMail
A simple command line based email client written in Python.

This new program is based on my old python email client which you can find here: https://github.com/Tijndagamer/Python_Email_Client

# Installation

First, clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/Tijndagamer/PyMail.git
    
Then make config and pymail executable:

    cd PyMail/src
    chmod +x config
    chmod +x pymail
    
Then you can move pymail to ~/bin/ so you can use it everywhere:

    mv pymail ~/bin/
    
If you don't want to re-enter your credentials every time you use PyMail you can run

     pymail config
     
This will store your credentials in a place where PyMail can find it, but please note that the files generated by config **are not encrypted or protected.** 

# Use

####There are multiple ways of using PyMail, here are the most important ways:

#####Sending an email can be done in two ways.

The first way is to simply run this command:

    pymail send
    
After you hit enter, you wil be prompted to enter the email address of the receiver of the email, the subject of the email and the body of the email.

The second way is to this command:

    pymail send <receiver> <subject> <body>
    
This will immediately sent the email to <receiver> with <subject> as subject and <body> as body.
**Please note that both `<receiver>` and `<subject>` cannot contain any spaces.**

#####Receiving an email can also be done in two ways.

The first way is to simply run this command:

    pymail receive
    
This command will retrieve and print the latest email.

The second way is to run this command:

    pymail receive <n>
    
This will retrieve the nth email in your email. (-1 being the latest email you got)

**Tip:** If you're receiving a fancier email full of HTML you can tunnel the output to a html file like this:

    pymail receive > email.html

######Other options

If you're not sure what the options were again, run this:

    pymail help
    
This command wil print a short list of all the possibilities, without an explanation.

# Known issues

* When the subject is given from the command line it cannot have any spaces in it
